SocialNU API - Assignment 5

Approach

I developed a RESTful API using Node.js and Express to connect the SocialNU frontend with a PostgreSQL database. The backend handles data retrieval using the pg library, and sensitive credentials are managed securely through a .env file.

Key Takeaways

- Learned how to integrate a live database with a React application.

- Gained experience in using environment variables for both backend and frontend security.

- Understood the process of fetching and rendering dynamic data in a grid layout.

Challenges
Synchronized the database schema with the existing UI components to ensure the 6-student grid displays correctly.

Mapped database query results to React state to maintain design consistency.
